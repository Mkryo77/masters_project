This repository is dedicated to showcasing the highlights from my masters project for my MPhys Physics and Astronomy Degree at Durham University. The project is titled "Plant Species and Pathogen Identification with Reflectance Spectra, UAV Imagery and Machine Learning" and my goal is to develop a remote method of classifying species of plants and assessing their health using just a few measurements of reflectance off of their leaves. To do this I have been supplied with a dataset consisting of 798 mangrove trees, with this being split amongst three different species in the ratio: 250 red, 218 white and 330 black. As a start, I attempt to solve this problem using a manual statistical approach before bringing in machine learning algorithms to see if any improvements on the results can be made. So far I have completed the manual approach and am in the process of developing a neural network to try to solve the problem.
